# MyReads Project

This repository contains my implementation of the MyReads app. This is the final assessment project for the
Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the [React Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
MyReads is a simple cataloging app that allows you to place books in one of three shelves or categories.

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

It also allow you to search for books based on title and author.

This app is the first of three projects required for [Udacity's React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't 
have any installed on your system. 

* npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, 
you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

or

* Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
